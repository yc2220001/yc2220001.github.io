Research: As a student pursuing a Ph.D. in Civil Engineering and Hydraulics, I am working to explore the creative integration between data science, numerical methods, and ocean, geology, and geotechnics. My main interests focus on soil-water couplingÂ processes, meshless methods, fluid-structure interaction analysis, and high-performance computing platform development.
Previously: I received my Bachelor's degree in Civil Engineering from Southwestern University.
